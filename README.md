# NodeJS-Template-Application
Home-made back-end template for use on Node.JS projects. The server is launched in a Node.JS environment on the port specified in the /app.js, creating a basic web-server providing URL-routing for assets, pages and requests functionality. The application is intended to use with AngularJS, but is easily compatible with other techniques.
